# ExtendedRebuildingModules
Note: This mod is for V5 and utilizes outdated mechanic and building type, therefore will not be updated for V6+ ever.

This mod aims to add more playable ships and mechs with different specializations.  
Currently the mod supports 3 new ships and 1 new mech to chose from:

Sister Ship  
Alternative construction ship model which trades damage for ability to heal buildings.
Unlike Tau Class Mech, Sister Class Ship has advantage in mobility, although lacks durability and battle capabilities.  
Weapon: Structural Projector  
Weapon damage: 7  
*Weapon healing: 2%  
*Heal Based Weapon  
Health: 175  
Mine speed: 125%  
Drillpower: 100%  
Buildpower: 100%  
Storage: 26

Stalker Mech  
Heavily armored close combat specialised mech. Stalker is equipped with dual proton pulsators that shoot in bursts of protonic charges, 
dealing massive damage at close range. Stalkers cannot be manufactured on the surface, 
so they are constructed on mothership and are sent to the drop points on request. 
Please do not toss them at enemies' meltdowns and spectres, Stalkers are quite expensive.  
Weapon: Proton Pulsators  
Weapon damage: 16  
*Weapon shots: 14  
*Shotgun Based Weapon  
Health: 600  
Mine speed: 150%  
Drillpower: 100%  
Buildpower: 90%  
Storage: 48  

Reaver Ship  
Heavy assault gunship, designed for air-ground support actions. 
Armed with heavy A100 minigun at the cost of weak construction and mining projectors. 
While 'Reaver' is gunship's official name, people often call it 'Black Pearl' or 'Flying Dutchman'. 
And now this ship is literally associated with legends of space pirates.  
Weapon: A100  
Weapon damage: 14  
Health: 1250  
Mine speed: 50%  
Drillpower: 100%  
Buildpower: 50%  
Storage: 120  

**Yamato Battlecruiser  
510 years of inhuman experiments on a Meltdown turrets led us to this pinnacle of spacecraft. 
Armed with amplified version of Meltdown, that does not overheat, comes with pre-installed internal impact reactor 
that fuels the Meltdown onboard. And best part is that this abomination can actually move!  
*Weapon: Meltdown  
*Exactly  
Health: 5000  
Mine speed: 0%  
Drillpower: 0%  
Buildpower: 100%  
Storage: 600  
**In the near future will be either removed from the mod or fully reworked in favor of a unigue weapon and ability, rather then meltdown.  

V1.3 coming soon:
- New Mech
- New Ship
- Yamato rework

V1.2 strikes:
- Reaver ship was resprited
- Minor balance tweaks
- Mech weapon is now specified in the database

V1.1:  
- Mod updated to the newest build 100  
- Added russian localisation | Добавлена русская локализация.  
- Buffed Sister attackspeed, raising her combat and healing capabilities while not making them utter good.  
- Lowered build cost for Sister Ship Pad - Updated sprites for Yamato Construction Facility(Meltdown Ship Pad) and Reaver bullets.  
- Reaver weapon rework. Raised bullet velocity, no longer keeps ship velocity.  
- Yamato weapon rework. Behaves like real meltdown beam, holding itself. When ship is idle, beam will start sweeping in an arc.  
- I finally figured out how github works.
