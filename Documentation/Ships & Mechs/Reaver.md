# Reaver Ship  

Heavy assault gunship, designed <br>
for air-ground support actions.

Armed with heavy A100 minigun <br>
at the cost of weak construction <br>
and mining projectors.

While ***Reaver*** is gunship's official <br>
name, people often call it ***Black*** <br>
***Pearl*** or ***Flying Dutchman***.

Now this ship is literally associated <br>
with legends of space pirates.
