# Stalker Mech

Heavily armored close combat specialized mech.

The Stalker is equipped with dual proton pulsators <br>
that shoot in bursts with protonic charges, dealing <br>
massive damage at close range.

Stalkers cannot be manufactured on the surface, <br>
so they are constructed on mother-ship and are <br>
sent to the drop points on request.

Please do not toss them at enemies' meltdowns <br>
and specters, Stalkers are quite expensive.
