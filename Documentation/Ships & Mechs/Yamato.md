# Yamato Battlecruiser

510 years of inhuman experiments on a <br>
Meltdown turrets led us to this pinnacle <br>
of spacecraft. 

Armed with an amplified version of Meltdown, <br>
that does not overheat and has a pre-installed <br>
internal impact reactor that provides fuel.

The best part about this abomination <br>
is that it is actually able to move!
